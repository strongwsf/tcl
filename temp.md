Thank you for your reply!
I have remembered that my Nexon account is "qwe".Since this email is no longer accessible, I am unable to retrieve my password via it.Therefore, I still require your assistance.
This account has a history of recharge activities. Below are screenshots of all the transaction details I could find, serving as proof of my ownership of this account.
Thank you once again for all the help you have provided me!
